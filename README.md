## Project Description
SignMeUp is a course registration application that allows for users to easily view and register for courses that have been added to the application. Users are able to create courses and upload them to application so that they can be visible to other users, additional configurations such as course descriptions, start and end times, and max attendee limits can be specified as well. Users are able to register for open courses and view them in a convenient dashboard view that allows for them to explore the details of the registered course.
